<p>Using Gnome Shell or Gnome 3 (they are actually kind of the same thing)? Then you will love the following extensions:</p>
<p><strong>All in one places</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/299/all-in-one-places/">https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/299/all-in-one-places/</a></p>
<p>Shows a small button at the top bar with links to specific folders. You&#8217;ll love it if you miss the Places menu in Gnome 2</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Status Menu (my favourite)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5/alternative-status-menu/">https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5/alternative-status-menu/</a></p>
<p>This is the best one, because for some reason, Gnome removed some very useful buttons to power off, hibernate and suspend your machine. This one restores them.</p>
<p><strong>Dash to dock (my second favourite)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/">https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/</a></p>
<p>The dock without you having to enter the activities workspace.</p>
<p><strong>NetSpeed</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/104/netspeed/">https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/104/netspeed/</a></p>
<p>Shows the speed of your WLAN or ETH connection.</p>
<p><strong>Tracker Search</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/284/tracker-search/">https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/284/tracker-search/</a></p>
<p>This is another favourite, allows you to actually search documents from the Gnome Shell Search bar. Without this one, you can only search recent documents.</p>
<p><strong>Show Desktop Button</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/64/show-desktop-button/">https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/64/show-desktop-button/</a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using your Desktop as your traditional Desktop, where you can drop icons and documents, then you&#8217;ll need this one to quick access it.</p>
