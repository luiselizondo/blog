<p>I recently started organizing my bookmarks, which are a huge mess. But I found something I bookmarked a long time ago and I wanted to share it. It's a very simple website that I found a long time ago that can help you create a cool name for your startup. It's very simple to use, free and have some great features like searching for taken domains with that word. Try it out:</p><p>http://wordoid.com/</p>
