<p>I&#8217;ll be posting some of the differences between Fedora 17 and Ubuntu 12.04 I do not pretend to create a really long blog post, instead, I&#8217;ll create a series of posts with the differences. Before I begin with the first battle, I must say that I&#8217;ve been using Ubuntu since 7.04, that means since 2007, in other words, I&#8217;ve been using Ubuntu for 6 years now and I absolute love it. It is my main and primary OS at Home and at my Office.</p>
<p>A month ago I got a new laptop at the office, and I decided that I wasn&#8217;t gonna install Ubuntu, instead, I choose Fedora, mainly because I wanted to try the <strike>new</strike> not so new by now Gnome 3 which I heard really bad opinions about it, but I also didn&#8217;t want to mess with my current setup.</p>
<p>My opinion on Gnome 3 is a matter for another post by itself. So, here is the first battle.</p>
<p>Battle: Open a file or directory with a single command from terminal.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m missing something but this is something really easy to do in Ubuntu. I just do:</p>
<p>gnome-open some-file</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>gnome-open directory</p>
<p>and both will launch on the UI using the default application configured to open the file. I can take it further if I create an alias for gnome-open so I don&#8217;t have to type gnome-. As you can see, it is easier to just do open file. Mac has been doing this for years.</p>
<p>Well, today I found out that this is not possible (if you do know how to do it please tell me). The closest you can get is to only open directories with:</p>
<p>nautilus directory</p>
<p>But no files.</p>
<p>Winner: Ubuntu</p>
