<p>Something that easy sould be obvious right? Well, aparently it's not. I use LibreOffice as my main and only Office Suite and most of the time (that includes good days) I just hate LibreOffice / OpenOffice templates, I think that's one area that we're years behind Microsoft Office. Anyway, back to business. If you want to create your own templates you might find hard to know where the hell to add the files so you can access them when you're creating a new document. I'm not gonna cover how to create a new template, but only what to do with the files after you create the template.</p><p>Open LibreOffice (this may work for OpenOffice too) and go to Tools -&gt; Options, there you'll find "Paths", it will look like the following:</p><p>[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"7","attributes":{"alt":"","class":"media-image","height":"252","typeof":"foaf:Image","width":"480"}}]]</p><p>You'll see there's a "Templates" option. Select it and click "Edit". You'll see there are multiple locations where LibreOffice will read template files. Select the default, in my case, I like them to be in sync with Dropbox so I choose "/home/luis/Documents/Templates". If you don't have a Templates directory create a new one or just click "Add" and add a new path.</p><p>[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"8","attributes":{"alt":"","class":"media-image","height":"251","typeof":"foaf:Image","width":"480"}}]]</p><p>Once you have your files in the location you've choosen, add the template files to your directory.</p><p>[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"9","attributes":{"alt":"","class":"media-image","height":"256","typeof":"foaf:Image","width":"480"}}]]</p><p>And there you have it, now when you create a new LibreOffice document, you can go to Templates &amp; Documents and your template will be there.</p><p>[[{"type":"media","view_mode":"media_large","fid":"10","attributes":{"alt":"","class":"media-image","height":"273","typeof":"foaf:Image","width":"480"}}]]</p><p>Have fun and if you create a really cool template, please share with the community.</p>
