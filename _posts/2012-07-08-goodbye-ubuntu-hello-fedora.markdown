<p>Yes, I finally did it. This weekend I installed Fedora 17 and stopped using Ubuntu on my home pc. I used it since 7.04 as my main operating system, no more.</p>
<p>It all started a month ago when I received a new laptop at work with Win7 and I decided to install Fedora. We&#8217;re moving some servers to CentOS so I decided it was time to give it a try.</p>
<p>I heard the worst opinions about Gnome 3, but after one week period, I just loved it! After a month, I wanted to install it on my home pc. So I did, I decided to install the gnome-shell on my Ubuntu 12.04 pc. Total failure.</p>
<p>The Window Manager crashed, the Graphic Driver stopped working. So I decided to make a backup of my home partition and reinstall Ubuntu, after all I&#8217;ve been upgrading on that PC since 10.04. I did and Ubuntu 12.04 complained about one or two things. I said before that Cannonical messed up with 12.04 because a few months after the release is not stable and this was the change to prove it since I always thought that all the problems were because I&#8217;ve been upgrading my PC for more than 2 years.</p>
<p>But even after a clean install, I still got Unity, which I like but now I wanted Gnome 3. So I decided to download Fedora and install it.</p>
<p>The most amazing part is that I didn&#8217;t have a single problem. After 20 minutes installing I just booted (I was a little nervous) and I was up and running. </p>
<p>I will explain why I&#8217;m starting to love Gnome 3 in another post. I still like Ubuntu, specially the server edition, I don&#8217;t have any problem with it. But the desktop version, well, let&#8217;s just say that for the first time, is possible that I skip a few versions until Ubuntu surprises me again, just like it did the first time I used it. </p>
