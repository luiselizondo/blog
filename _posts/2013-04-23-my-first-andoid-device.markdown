I got a Celmi Tablet running Android Ice Cream Sandwich and it's not only myfirst tablet, but also my first Android device.

The device, it's not something nice, but it  works.  It has a small front camera to have video  conferences, it has 7'' screen with a poor display (specially if  you compare it against the Apple Retina display), it has not so good speaker, it comes with 2GB of HD and 256MB in RAM and  probably the worst Wireless adapter in the world, it's so bad, that you only get about 80% of signal standing just inches from the router. 

But it has some nice stuff too. I can use a standard HDMI cable to connect toa HD screen, it  has a SDCard port, a USB port and a mini USB port, so I do have ways of expanding the little thing. 

What's most sorprising to me it's the fact that it came with a nice and small keyboard, it's not really confotable to  work with but you get used to it.

What I really like about this device it's the fact that I can actually do some work with it, right now I'm witting this blog post using Documents to Go Pro version (it already came with it), and I'm moving forward. I can do pretty much anything  I can do with a computer, only slower, but hey, this is supposed to be a device to consume content, not to produce it or do anything you want with it, but if I'm out of the city and I needed to do some work, I'd definetly rather use my tablet than my iPhone.

I can work with files, move them around, send them to different applications and even send them to dropbox or Google Drive. Something I just cant do with an iOS device.

Overall, I give it a 7.5, the problems  with the wireless device are a real PITA. Android it's also not that pretty as iOS,  yes, you  have lots of freedom, but you notice the differences in the  keyboard and things that have nothing to do with freedom. Finally, there's almost all the apps I use on my iPhone with the exception of Zite, but I must mention that navigation it's much easier and feels moe intuitive in iOS devices.

I'm gonna stick with this tablet  for a while, but eventually I will buy my own tablet, and I guess I  will enjoy it more.
