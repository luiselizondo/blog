<p>Here's my list, Software I can't live without, and since I'm an Open Source Evangelist, I will only publish Open Source Software. I'm algo including a list of Cloud-based software.</p><h4>Open Source Software</h4><ul><li>Firefox (http://firefox.com)<br>Because it's the best browser available out there IMHO</li><li>Chrome (http://google.com/chrome)<br>Because it's fast and sometimes I need more than one browser</li><li>Sublime Text 2 (http://www.sublimetext.com/2)<br>To code, fast, pretty, awesome. (Non free)</li><li>LibreOffice / OpenOffice (<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">http://www.libreoffice.org/</a>)<br>Becuase it's Free, Open and Libre. I don't like MS Office, this one is (most of the time) a great alternative</li><li>Xmind<br>For when you want to organize your thoughts and share them.</li></ul><h4>Cloud-based software</h4><ul><li>Grooveshark (http://grooveshark.com)<br>Take your music everywhere, for free. Awesome.</li><li>Github (http://github.com/)<br>To publish and save my code</li><li>Evernote (http://evernote.com)<br>To save information that I want to preserve.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
