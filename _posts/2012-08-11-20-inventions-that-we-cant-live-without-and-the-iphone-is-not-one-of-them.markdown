<p>Yeah. There&#8217;s a list of things that where invented sometime in the past, who&#8217;s inventors are not as known and recognized as Steve Jobs. Those things we take for granted, but that are more important than the iPhone. This is a list of things we couldn&#8217;t live without.</p>
<p><strong>Ice and the Ice machine</strong></p>
<p>Think about it. When was the last time you had a hot diet coke? Not a good experience? I thought so too. The fact is the Ice machine, freezers and Ice itself (although this was provided by nature) is a great invention. When humanity &#8220;invented&#8221; or controlled fire it was a huge step forward, but making ice out of liquid water is not as simple, many things had to happen before we could enjoy a nice Ice Tea or a cold Diet Coke.</p>
<p>For all I know, the &#8220;invention of Ice&#8221; is worth of the Nobel Prize of Physics.</p>
