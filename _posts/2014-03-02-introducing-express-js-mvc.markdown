I’ve been using Express.js for quite a while now, it’s a great Node.js framework, easy to use, solid, flexible and with a great community behind. Nevertheless, sometimes I feel frustrated when I start a new application and have to start from scratch. 

Today I’m releasing Express.js MVC under the MIT License. Some of the goals of Express.js MVC are to modularize the framework by introducing a very simple structure and an easy to use and decentralized module manager. Now, it will be possible to reuse your own modules or even share them, all of it without having to learn a new framework.

The framework also comes with hacks so you can easily enable events throughout the entire application, include views in your modules, disable and enable modules in a configuration file, and even require models, controllers and libraries without having to use relative routes to load them.

I invite you to fork the project, contribute back to the community, create modules and even share them with the world and tell me what you think.

P.D. The version 3.4.x is the first version released and it will change at the same pace express.js does.
